                Hello? Hello? Hello?
                Is there anybody in there?
                Just nod if you can hear me
                Is there anyone at home?
                Come on now
                I hear you're feeling down
                Well I can ease your pain
                Get you on your feet again
                Relax
                I'll need some information first
                Just the basic facts
                Can you show me where it hurts?
            </p>

            <p>
                There is no pain you are receding
                A distant ship smoke on the horizon
                You are only coming through in waves
                Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
                When I was a child I had a fever
                My hands felt just like two balloons
                Now I've got that feeling once again
                I can't explain you would not understand
                This is not how I am
                I have become comfortably numb
            </p>

            <p>
                Okay
                Just a little pinprick
                There'll be no more, ah
                But you may feel a little sick
                Can you stand up?
                I do believe it's working, good
                That'll keep you going through the show
                Come on it's time to go
            </p>

            <p>
                There is no pain you are receding
                A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
                You are only coming through in waves
                Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
                When I was a child
                I caught a fleeting glimpse
                Out of the corner of my eye
                I turned to look but it was gone
                I cannot put my finger on it now
                The child is grown
                The dream is gone
                I have become comfortably numb
            </p>
